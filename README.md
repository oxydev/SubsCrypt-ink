This is ink! implementation of SubsCrypt. For more information please visit [online docs](https://oxydev.github.io/SubsCrypt-docs/#/).

## Installing

Please make sure that you have these prerequisites installed on your computer:

```bash
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
```

Then you have to install ink! command line utility which will make setting up Substrate smart contract projects easier:

```bash
cargo install cargo-contract --vers 0.10.0 --force --locked
```

You also need the [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) package installed on your computer which is used to optimize the WebAssembly bytecode of the contract, you can use npm to install it:

```bash
npm install -g binaryen
```

## Testing

First of all you need to clone the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxydev/SubsCrypt-ink
cd SubsCrypt-ink
```

Then, you can run the tests with this line of code:

```bash
cargo +nightly test
```

## Building

To build the WASM of your contract and metadata, you can clone and change directory to the ink project of SubsCrypt and then you have to run this line:

```bash
cargo +nightly contract build
```

This command will take some minutes and the output will be something like this:

```bash
Original wasm size: 99.1K, Optimized: 68.0K

Your contract artifacts are ready. You can find them in:
/yourDirectory/target/ink

  - SubsCrypt.contract (code + metadata)
  - SubsCrypt.wasm (the contract's code)
  - metadata.json (the contract's metadata)
```
 
You can also use the pre-built version of our code and access to the WASM and metadata files, [here](https://github.com/oxydev/SubsCrypt-ink/blob/main/deploy/SubsCrypt.wasm) and [here](https://github.com/oxydev/SubsCrypt-ink/blob/main/deploy/metadata.json).
